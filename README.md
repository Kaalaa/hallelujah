# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running ...

... but in this special case, it is going to tell you something about the
creator of this mess :D

Karla already took Computer Science as a major in high school, but somehow her
many interests lead her into business studies (and a lot of extracurricular
activities on the side). But somehow the tech world has never really let go
of her, so here she is, torturing you with her RoR experiments. Good luck!
